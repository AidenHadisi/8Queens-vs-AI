8 Queens vs. Artificial Intelligence
===

## Demo
A demo is available [here](https://ai8queens.herokuapp.com).

## Problem Statement
This application attempts to solve the 8-Queens problem using a genetic algorithm. 
Given one queen in each column, the A.I. will move the queens to different squares until no queens are attacking each other.

## Approach
A genetic algorithm is used to solve this problem. The algorithm begins with 100 random individuals as a population, if the solution is not found in the population the algorithm generates new children by performing crossover and mutations until a solution is found.
